GirishInTech: Build this entire using plain JavaScript (no TypeScript) with the MERN stack — React (with Vite), Express, MongoDB, and Node.js.
Keep the code clean, beginner-friendly, and fully commented so I can understand it easily.
Use Tailwind CSS for styling, JWT for authentication, and simple .env configs.
Do not use TypeScript or advanced abstractions — just working, readable JavaScript code for learning purposes.


TeamFinder is a web-based collaboration platform designed for college students to discover events like hackathons, ideathons, and research competitions, and to form teams based on shared interests and complementary skills.

It solves a real problem faced in many colleges — where event announcements are scattered across WhatsApp groups, emails, and notice boards — and students often miss opportunities or struggle to find the right teammates.

TeamFinder brings everything together in one smart, AI-assisted web app.

🎯 Objective

To build a beginner-friendly MERN stack application that allows:

Admins to post and manage college events (hackathons, research challenges, etc.)

Students to view events, register, and find teammates based on skills and experience.

AI-powered features to extract event details from uploaded brochures and answer event-related questions.

A clean, modern, responsive UI built using React + Vite + Tailwind CSS.

🧱 Tech Stack
Layer	Technology
Frontend	React.js + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
Backend	Node.js + Express.js + TypeScript
Database	MongoDB + Mongoose
Authentication	JWT (email/password); placeholder for Google OAuth
AI Integration	Gemini or OpenAI API (stubbed initially)
File Uploads	Local storage (dev) or Cloudinary (optional later)
Hosting	Localhost for now; deploy later (Render/Vercel)
⚙️ Core Functionalities
1. User Authentication

Students and admins can register and log in using email/password.

Secure authentication using JWT (access + refresh tokens).

Role-based access control (admin, student).

2. Student Profiles

Each user has a profile that contains:

Name, email, branch, year, course

Skills (list of strings, e.g. “Python”, “React”, “ML”)

Achievements (list of strings)

Stats: number of events participated in and events won

Option to edit profile anytime

3. Admin Event Management

Admins can:

Create new events with details like:

Event name, description, category

Rules, eligibility criteria

Team size limits (min, max)

Start and end dates, registration deadlines

Upload brochure/image (optional)

Edit or delete existing events

Manage event participation lists

4. Event Feed

Students can:

View all upcoming, ongoing, and past events

Filter events by category or status

Click on an event to view its full details (rules, team size, deadlines, etc.)

Join or form a team for that event

5. Team Formation

A student can create a team for any open event.

Team leader can invite others by name or email.

Invited users can accept or reject invitations.

Teams must respect the event’s team size limit.

A simple view to see all current members and pending invites.

6. Skill-Based Teammate Search

Students can search for potential teammates by skill or interest.

Example search: “React”, “Machine Learning”, “Cloud”.

Search results are ranked based on:

Number of skill matches

Number of past events participated in

Activity level on the platform

Each result shows: name, skills, experience stats, and a quick invite option.

7. AI Event Parsing (Stub)

Admins can upload PDFs or brochures when creating events.

The system uses an AI parser stub (mock service) to extract:

Event name

Rules

Team size limits

Dates and deadlines

Categories

Currently returns deterministic mock data (later replaceable with real AI API).

8. AI Chatbot (Stub)

Each event has a built-in “Ask Chatbot” section.

Students can ask questions like:

“What’s the registration deadline?”

“How many people per team?”

The chatbot responds using the stored event data (keyword-based for now).

Later, this can be replaced with a fine-tuned Gemini/OpenAI model.

9. Dashboard

Displays personalized recommendations:

Upcoming events related to user skills

Suggested teammates

Recent team invites or updates

10. Notifications (Optional Stub)

Basic in-app notifications (console or toast).

Later extendable to email/WhatsApp alerts.

🧩 Summary

TeamFinder unifies event discovery, team formation, and skill-based collaboration for college students.
It’s realistic, innovative, scalable, and designed to look startup-grade, yet is beginner-friendly to build using MERN + Vite.
AI modules are structured as pluggable stubs — letting you extend functionality easily later.

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you build TeamFinder as a complete MERN stack application with plain JavaScript. Let me start by creating the project structure and implementing all the features you've described.
